# MacOS-Calculator
A MacOS Basic Calculator built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

A challenge I set myself to see if I could build a calculator that looked the same and would act the same as the MacOS Basic Calculator. The build was an iterative process with minimal planning from the outset.

If I had to do this again, I would write user stories for EVERY single action required. Then build from these requirements. But still, a great learning curve.
